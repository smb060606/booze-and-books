-- Fix RLS policy conflict that prevents book ownership transfer during swap completion
-- The issue: Two UPDATE policies on books table create an AND condition that blocks transfers
-- Solution: Use session variable to allow trigger to bypass RLS during legitimate swap transfers

-- Drop the conflicting policy added in migration 024
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow book ownership transfer during swap completion" ON books;

-- Update the existing RLS policy to allow transfers when session variable is set
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own books" ON books;

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own books" ON books
